# Blender

Blender is an amazing open source software used for 3d modeling, texturing, sculpting, rigging, animation and much more things.

It can also be used for 2d design and animation as well.

There are various styles which are possible to create with Blender using the render engines Cycles/Eevee.

Cycles Engine: It is used for photo realistic render since it uses light rays with ray tracing which results in both direct and indirect lighting in the scene through the light sources.

Eevee Engine: It is used for a stylized/artistic render of the camera view. The Shader to RGB node is usually used to make stylized shaders for 3D objects(The movie Flow, which won the best animated feature film in Oscar's was rendered using this engine).

Blender might be overwhelming at first, but it is just an awesome software. Please dont give up while learning, it just gets better and gets much more fun.

You can use this repo as a reference or to export few models for Game Design as well. Have fun learning.

Thanks for the Blender Development team for this amazing software, I totally had a blast with it and will keep on learning.
